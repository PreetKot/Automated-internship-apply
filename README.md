## 🚀 What is this project?

This repository provides an out-of-the-box, no-code (or low-code) *n8n* workflow designed to help you:

- **Automate the collection** of internship application data from forms or other sources.
- **Store and organize** candidate information in Google Sheets, Notion, databases, or other platforms.
- **Send automated notifications** to applicants and HR teams (e.g., “application received”, “interview scheduled”).
- **Schedule interviews** and manage communication using integrated tools (Google Calendar, Slack, Email, etc.).
- **Screen and filter applications** based on customizable criteria.

You can adapt this workflow for your own organization, or use it as a personal assistant for applying to internships online.
